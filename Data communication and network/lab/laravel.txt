MVC:
All the front end part is done in view part. All the database related work, queries we 
will write in in model.
All the logical part in controller: For eg, in login page all front-end is in view, 
All the queries related to the login data is in model. Controller calls the login view
when the user opens the login page. When login view give some data it goes in the controller
and from there controller calls the SQL query from model and check if the data exist.
This is the structure of MVC.
